                    <h4>Division:</h4>
                    <p>The division is one of the basic arithmetic operations in math in which a larger number is broken down into smaller groups having the same number of items. 
                        For example, for a sports event, if 30 students need to be divided into groups of 5 students, then how many total groups will be formed? 
                        Such problems can be solved easily using the division operation. Here we need to divide 30 by 5.
                        The result will be 30 ÷ 5 = 6. So, there will be 6 groups of 5 students in each. 
                        You can verify this value by multiplying 6 and 5, which will give you the original number, 30.
                        Each part involved in a division equation has a special name. 

                        Dividend: The dividend is the number that is being divided in the division process. 

                        Divisor: The number by which the dividend is being divided by is called the divisor.

                        Quotient: The quotient is a result obtained in the division process.

                        Remainder: Sometimes, we cannot divide things exactly. There may be a leftover number. That leftover number is called the remainder. 
                        Dividend = (Divisor × Quotient) + Remainder</p>

                    <p>In mathematics, multiplication is the process of adding a number to itself a certain number of times. It is represented by the multiplication symbol (*), which is also known as the “times” symbol. For example, multiplying 3 by 4 can be expressed as 3 * 4, and the result is 12.</p>

                    <h4>Addition:</h4>
                    <p>The addition is the term used to describe adding two or more numbers together. 
                    The addition is denoted using the plus sign ‘+‘ such as the addition of 3 and 3 can be written as 3 + 3. 
                    Also, the plus sign (+) can be used as many times as required, such as 3 + 3 + 3 + 3. </p>
                </list>
                <list><h4>Subtraction:</h4>
                    <p>Subtraction represents the operation of removing objects from a collection. 
                        The minus sign signifies subtraction −. For example, there are nine oranges arranged as a stack (as shown in the above figure), out of which four oranges are transferred to a basket, then there will be 9 – 4 oranges left in the stack, i.e. five oranges. 
                        Therefore, the difference between 9 and 4 is 5, i.e., 9 − 4 = 5. </p>
